In this project, we are building a credit risk analysis from a dataset that has an unbalanced classification problem. We are looking to identify possibly risky loans out of the good ones. We will be using scikit-learn libraries from Python to create generate machine learning. Through scikit-learn, we will be utilizing ensemble learning and unbalanced learning. We will use a dataset from LendingClub as the basis of our data analysis, and to perform our model prediction evaluations from.
